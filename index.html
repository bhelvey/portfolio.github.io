    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <!-- <p class="margin-bottom">I have been expanding my horizons in programming ever so slightly since High School.
        Starting with Unity for my first taste of C# and object oriented programming which ended up being a lot of fun. 
        Creating games, playing games and understanding how all objects interact with eachother was extremely interesting.
        After High School I landed a job in Quality Control at an aerospace company that mainly manufactures gears, rotors, clutch
        assemblies and more. Here I was exposed to learning a new program (Discus) from scratch and the OCR inside fascinated me.  
        Like any OCR at the time it was not perfect and had to be edited within the excel spreadsheets and formatted. The highlight of
        that time was working with the M&M 3515 Gear analyzer which took into account all types of gear dimensions and checked them 
        for non conformance.This also allowed us to start getting some internal calibration of internal gages used for production.
        Working with the robotic arm was a highlight of my time and an inspiration to understand more on how it works and how can I make 
        something similar. The dabbling in Unity and my time working in aerospace sparked an interest for programming which lead to taking a 
        C++ class while in college. Now it is a bit different then coding in unity obviously but the idea to create something raw piqued my intrest.
        At the time it was a hobby learning about programming languages and something that would help understand how programs work but the fire 
        always has been lit to create something useful. When an opportunity came about for a vast expansion of programming came from the University Of Oregon.
        I had always seen coding bootcamps this and that but the opportunity at University of Oregon in the data analytics bootcamp my eyes lit up. Here is where
        I was exposed to Python, API's,JavaScript, Advanced Excel, NumPy, Pandas, Sql, Html, Css and Machine learning.
